  Speed Racer is the titular charcter of the show. He is the best racer in his league 
  but is somehow always underrated by his peers or lack-there-of. Speed's car, <b><i> the Mach 5</i></b>,
  is one of the most aero-dynamic cars in the series and is equipt with many defense systems,
  weapons, and augmented accessories to assist him in his races. Above all of that though, Speed
  has a good heart and that always makes you root for him.
